primitive variables - simple value stored in a memory (stack)
reference variables - memory address (stack) that points to the (heap)
primitive - int , double , char , boolean
reference - string , array , object 
next(), which reads only a single word or token delimited by whitespace
nextLine() captures the entire line of text, including spaces and other characters.
nextInt() - takes int
nextDouble() - takes floating till many times precision
nextBoolean() - takes true/false as input

input buffer means - after taking int/double as input there is a \n then if you take string as input then \n goes to string and then this problem occur...so best practice is that use nextLine() method(sc.nextLine(); like this) after int as input/double and then string
"cm²²" - to make superscript ..select the number/thing you want to superscript..on numlock....while holding alt key press 0178 - power 2 /0179 - power 3


Order of operations - PEMDAS - parantheses, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction

in if /else if - you can use boolean values as well
for eg - isloggedin = true  if(isloggedin)


random number -> Random random = new Random();
 int n = random.nextInt();
 range of n - -2 billion to =2 billion

int n = random.nextInt(1,6)
1 is inclusive bound 
6 is exclusive bound means it is not included
1,6 means it generate random numbers between 1 to 5(5 is there 6 will not be included)


double b = random.nextDouble() - it generate random double number between 0 and 1 


Math.pow(double a, double b) == a to the power be
Math.abs(-a) == gives positive value means modulous
Math.sqrt() == gives square root
Math.round(3.14) == gives round off -- gives 3
Math.ceil(3.14) = 4 
Math.floor(3.99) = 3
Math.max(10,20) == 20
Math.min(10,20) == 10
